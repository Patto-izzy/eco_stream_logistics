# Testing & Review

## Technical tests

- Responsive: resize viewport to mobile (<= 600px), tablet, desktop and verify layout.
- Accessibility: use keyboard tab order, ensure focus outlines are visible; run an automated check (e.g. Lighthouse or axe).
- Forms: try submitting empty form to see validation; test email validation.
- Links: ensure navigation links pages load.

## User acceptance testing suggestions

- Give to a friend or teacher and ask: "Can you find prices in under 30 seconds?" and "Can you request a quote?"
- Ask for feedback on clarity and trustworthiness.
